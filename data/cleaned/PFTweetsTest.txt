635166727651856384	zlatan	1	Zlatan is simply saving himself for the 2nd leg		
635179934365941760	zlatan	1	@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.		
635220412155105280	zlatan	1	@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !		
635924485753991169	zlatan	0	The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan)		
636025757672820736	zlatan	1	I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal		
636255247992758272	zlatan	0	@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore

638013292036923392	zlatan	1	Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season		
638018562334916609	zlatan	1	Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.		
638033582112534529	zlatan	1	Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze

640276909633486849	zlatan	-1	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC

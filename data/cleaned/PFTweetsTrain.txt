639378600211251204	federer	1	@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.		
639418110781472768	federer	1	I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!		
639424209945501696	federer	1	Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves		
639574179172454400	federer	1	Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.		
639589478638743552	federer	1	Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.		
639599584252166144	federer	1	Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!		
639704216920027136	federer	1	Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!		
639778162654748672	federer	1	Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round		
639901380950499328	federer	0	Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow		
640023722141831169	federer	0	The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw.		
640039841300901888	federer	0	@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,		
640149748763217920	federer	0	Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.		
640210392829042688	federer	1	Most Masters 1000 titles (27) 2nd most Grand Slam titles (24 tied with Sampras after Federer's 17)		
640212019833085952	federer	1	Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen		
640213184088010752	federer	1	Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!		
640227149438390273	federer	0	Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd		
640227987342934016	federer	1	Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.		
640233756511440896	federer	0	Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!		
640234141431275521	federer	1	Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round		
640234182384480256	federer	1	5 time @usopen champion Federer defeats 29th seed Kohlschreiber and he's through to the last 16 to play 13th seed Isner or Vesely! #USOpen		
640234912025448448	federer	1	Federer is through to his 15th straight 4th round at the US Open. He's 8-4 with two other wins by walkover. http://t.co/p36dNjyxkV		
640235978569838592	federer	0	Shriver to Federer suggesting that he not use the SABR vs. Isner "You want to have your 3rd set of twins I'm sure."  Interview ended there.		
640245789311172608	federer	0	@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!		
640249529510547456	federer	1	Federer is gonna be playing in the championship on the first sunday of the nfl season. Tough decisions		
640268354423549952	federer	1	Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen

640270623516717056	federer	0	Federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. His first serve needs to be on point against Isner.		
640360671054557184	federer	0	Survey: Federer has ostensibly the toughest 4th round match, but is there a tougher one? Does Isner win a set? Does RBA?		
640426974645620736	federer	1	Federer advances into fourth round at US Open: In the blazing New York sun, Federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4

641066878375493633	federer	1	Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve		
641067646608371712	federer	1	Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015		
641074875982028800	federer	1	Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.		
641082313938305024	federer	0	'Sneak Attack By Roger' (SABR) causing errors this game for Federer. May be it's Isner's height #USOpen2015		
641084956274466816	federer	0	Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak		
641085537973997568	federer	1	Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.		
641085618169245700	federer	1	Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen		
641087405353779200	federer	1	I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"		
641088714014347264	federer	1	I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015		
641089660849127424	federer	1	That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el		
641094016289914880	federer	1	Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight		
641096525980938240	federer	1	Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen		
641096620172382208	federer	1	Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow		
641097239696293888	federer	1	In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.		
641097789565353985	federer	-1	i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !		
641099162243698688	federer	0	Disappointing end to the match for Isner. Would've liked to see a 3rd set tiebreak but Federer is a robot. He's ridiculous.		
641110299576258561	federer	1	@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak		
641127726192177152	federer	1	Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w		
641207353660960768	federer	1	With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g
